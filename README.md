## Future Plans for Project:
- OnlineList doesn't update
- If you refresh the page so does the voted variable, allowing you to do negative votes
- bright error flash every time a new username is entered on register
- better style things for resize
- Default video skips to 3 minutes in after video queue is done
- Roughly 4 second lag between HOST and local when logging in and a video is already playing
- after register, logout redirects to register screen but should be login
- scroll bar doesn't snap to the bottom (at least when posting pls)
